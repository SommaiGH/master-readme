# Name of Project: Bipolar disorder and lithium response:pharmacogenomics

Our project is presenting the analytic codes as part of the study, of which the manuscript, entitled "....", has been published in *Molecular Psychiatry*. [Ref or Doi will be added later]

The aim of the study in the manuscript is to identify the genetic contribution into lithium response in patients with bipolar disorder using multi-omics analysis of integrated between genome-wide association (GWAS) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data.

## Project Aim 

The purpose of this project is to distribute the codes that had been used in the multi-omics analysis of integrated between genome-wide association (GWAS) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data . The details of methods can be found in 1) the Method section in the main text and 2) the Supplemental Methods of the manuscript [Ref].

## The Project Workflow and File Descriptions

This project includes 3 main subdirectories as follows:

#### I. Genome-wide association study (GWAS)

-   **GWAS analysis & imputation:** we did not provide the code. Here’s the summary:

    -   DNA from 1106 subjects was genotyped on the Illumina Psychip. Genotypes were called using the Ricopili pipeline (<https://sites.google.com/a/broadinstitute.org/ricopili/>).

    -   Data was screened for low call rate, low genotyping rate, and Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Imputation was performed using IMPUTE2. Association was tested by linear regression as implemented in PLINK.

-   **A Versatile Gene-based Association Test (VEGAS):** [a web-based tool](https://vegas2.qimrberghofer.edu.au/) (Ref).

-   **GWAS boosting (GWAB) analysis:**

#### II. iPSC transcriptomic analyses

-   **Raw data of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)** -- stored in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et al., 2002) and are accessible through [**GEO Series accession number GSE205422**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE205422).

-   **RNA-seq analysis:**

    -   Differential expression analysis

    -   Input files:

        -   Data #1: Phenotype data, kelsoe_metadata_111.csv

        -   Data #2: Gene expression data, all_genes_results_111s.txt

#### III. Network and functional enrichment analysis

-   **Network propagation analysis**

-   **Cluster analysis**

-   **KEGG pathway analysis**

-   **Pathview creation**

-   **Input files:**

    -   Data #3: DE_Genes_Li and CTRL_LRvsNR_for_Katie.xlsx

    -   Data #4: prioritized_genes_boosting_methods_5percent_190708.xlsx
